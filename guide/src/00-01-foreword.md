# Foreword

PSudo is a programming language which focused on _Problem Solving_. Whatever you want to solve, Your solving will be _accelerated_.

For instance, Attention to I/O speed is really harmful in Problem Solving.
PSudo provides `input` statement and `output` statement so that you can handle I/O actions not only easier but also faster.
Additionally, you can configure how I/O actions work by `Compiler Directive`.

Besides, PSudo provides a toolchain which removes pitfalls, furthermore gives you a modern way.
Tools are designed ergonomically. We hope you to think that Problem Solving is easy and fun.

Moreover, PSudo purposes only Problem Solving, won't purposes general programming world.
So the features are designed to use be on Problem Solving. Also, standard libraries are.
