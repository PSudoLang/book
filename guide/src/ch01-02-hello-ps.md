# Hello, PS

We've installed PSudo, It's time to try!
Traditionally, When starting a new programming language,
Write down a little program prints `Hello, world!`.
So, Let's try it!

> Note: This book assumes you to know command-line interface.
> This book won't limit you to use editor or development tools

## Create a Folder

First, create a folder where store code.
It's not a matter where to place code,
But this book assumes that you're creating a `psudo-solutions` folder under the home directory.

> Note: PSudo never requires folder because codes and compiler configurations are stored in a single file.
> But we recommend you to create a folder and store all the PSudo codes on it. Because it is easier to organize.
